# 📸 Photography Portfolio — Wildlife & Portraits

This project is a personal photography portfolio showcasing my work in wildlife and portrait photography. It highlights some of my favorite shots, focusing on natural beauty, expressive storytelling, and high-quality visual presentation.

The portfolio is designed with a clean and minimal layout to ensure the photographs remain the central focus. It is fully responsive, offering a smooth viewing experience across desktop and mobile devices. The purpose of this project is to share my creative journey, document my growth as a photographer, and make my work accessible in one place.
